# Predicting-University_Admission_Likelihood
# 🎓 Predicting University Admission Likelihood

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a **predictive machine learning model** that estimates the likelihood of a student being **admitted (Yes)** or **rejected (No)** based on both academic and non-academic factors such as GPA, test scores, extracurricular activities, volunteer hours, recommendation letters, and essay scores.  

The project follows the **CRISP-DM methodology** to ensure a structured and systematic approach to data mining and machine learning.

## 🔑 Key Highlights
- Applied **data preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values (no null values present).  
  - Removed duplicates (dataset has no duplicates).  
  - Encoded categorical features.  
  - Scaled numerical features for better model performance.  
- Implemented **classification models** to predict admission likelihood.  
- Followed all **CRISP-DM steps**:  
  1. Business Understanding  
  2. Data Understanding  
  3. Data Preparation  
  4. Modeling  
  5. Evaluation  
  6. Deployment

## 🎯 Business Goal
- Support universities in making admission decisions that are **faster, fairer, and more efficient**.  
- Provide insights on the most **influential factors** affecting student admission.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development Environment)  

---

## ✅ Results
- Built a classification model achieving promising accuracy (≥80%).  
- Evaluated using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.  
- Generated insights to highlight which factors impact admission decisions the most.
